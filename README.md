Cognitive Workbench is a site to learn about and demo the capabilities of Azure Cognitive Services. The site aims to be a complement to already existing demos, samples and sites to make it easier to try out the capabilities, visulize results and explain how the services works.

The sites is targeted towards people familiar with Microsoft Azure and Cognitive Services and will require you to create resources in Azure and bring your own keys.

As of today, the site covers these services and API:s:

## Vision
